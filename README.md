# TimeTracker

This is an example Single Page Application in Elm, using
[elm-mdl](https://debois.github.io/elm-mdl/) for the UI widgets, that will
ultimately provide a basic, quasi-full-featured time tracker application
frontend in Elm.

## Elm bits

The elm client lives in ./elm.  Look there for more info.

## Backend bits

I intend to ultimately write a basic
[Phoenix-based](http://phoenixframework.org) backend API server for providing a
nice means to give examples of persistence, loading data from a CRUD backend,
etc.
